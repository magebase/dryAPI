# Limits & Quotas

This section contains a description of rate limits and file upload specifications.

dryAPI is engineered for High Throughput capability upon deployment. Unlike traditional providers, API scalability is not restricted by complex access levels during the initial integration phase.

***

## Account Types

All new accounts start as **Basic** and can upgrade to **Premium** by making any payment.

| Type        | Qualification                   |
| ----------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Basic**   | New accounts (no payments made) |
| **Premium** | Any payment made via Stripe     |

<Note>
  Upon registration, you receive a **\$5 bonus** added to your balance. This bonus is available for **Basic accounts** with conservative rate limits designed for testing and evaluation.

  To upgrade to **Premium** (300 RPM, unlimited daily requests), simply top up your account with any available amount. Your remaining bonus balance carries over — for example, if you use \$2 of your bonus and then purchase \$10, your total balance becomes \$13 (\$3 remaining + \$10 purchased), now usable with Premium limits.
</Note>

<Warning>
  Accounts registered with temporary or disposable email addresses do not receive the \$5 bonus. We value long-term users and honest usage.
</Warning>

***

## Rate Limits

Rate limits are defined per endpoint as:

* **RPM** — Requests Per Minute
* **RPD** — Requests Per Day

Limits reset daily at **midnight UTC**.

### Basic Limits

Basic accounts have conservative limits designed for testing and evaluation.

| **Whisper Transcription (shared)** | `WhisperLargeV3`     | 1   | 10  |

<Warning>
  **Whisper Shared Limit:** All four Whisper transcription endpoints share a single combined limit of **1 RPM** and **10 RPD**:

  * `/api/v1/client/videofile2txt` — Video file upload transcription
  * `/api/v1/client/aud2txt` — X Spaces transcription
  * `/api/v1/client/audiofile2txt` — Audio file upload transcription

  For example: 5× `/vid2txt` + 3× `/aud2txt` + 2× `/audiofile2txt` = 10 RPD ✓

<Info>
  Premium Whisper endpoints have independent limits — each endpoint has its own 300 RPM allocation.

### Endpoints Without Rate Limits

The following endpoints have no rate limits for all accounts:

* **Utilities** — `/balance`, `/models`

### dryAPI vs. Traditional Providers

Many AI infrastructure providers enforce restrictive initial limits, necessitating complex queue management systems for developers.

**Getting Started**

* Traditional Providers: Often require credit card verification or initial payment before any API access.
* dryAPI: Immediate access with \$5 bonus upon registration — no payment required to start testing.

**Scaling to Production**

* Traditional Providers: Typically require specific monetary spend thresholds (e.g., \$50+) and time delays (weeks/months) to unlock higher rate limits.
* dryAPI: Instant upgrade to Premium (300 RPM, unlimited daily requests) with any available top-up amount (\$10, \$25, or \$50).

**Limit Structure**

* Traditional Providers: Often utilize separate quotas for tokens (TPM), requests (RPM), daily limits (RPD), and per-model restrictions.
* dryAPI Premium: Simple unified structure — 300 RPM across all endpoints with unlimited daily requests.

## File Uploads

The majority of endpoints (Video-to-Text, Audio-to-Text, Image-to-Image) support direct binary file uploads or URL-based inputs. The global limits for file uploads are specified below.

**1. Video** (Video-to-Text, Image-to-Video)

* Max size: 80 MB
* Supported Formats: MP4, MPEG, QuickTime (MOV), AVI, WMV, OGG

**2. Audio** (Audio-to-Text, Voice Cloning reference audio, Audio-to-Video, Music reference audio)

* Max size: 80 MB
* Supported Formats: AAC, MP3, OGG, WAV, WebM, FLAC
* Voice Cloning reference audio: max 10 MB, 3–10 seconds duration. Supported formats: MP3, WAV, FLAC, OGG, M4A.
* Audio-to-Video conditioning audio: max 20 MB. Supported formats: MP3, WAV, OGG, FLAC.
* Music reference audio (style transfer): max 10 MB. Supported formats: MP3, WAV, FLAC, OGG, M4A.

**3. Images** (Image-to-Image, OCR)

* Max size: 10 MB
* Supported Formats: JPG, JPEG, PNG, GIF, BMP, WebP

***

## Model Parameter Limits

Certain parameters — such as maximum character count, image resolution, frame count, or audio duration — are **model-specific** and may differ between models available on the same endpoint.

These limits are returned dynamically via the [Models endpoint](/api/utilities/model-selection):

```bash  theme={null}
GET https://api.dryapi.dev/api/v1/client/models
```

Check the `limits` field in each model object to see the applicable constraints before submitting a request. This ensures your inputs stay within the accepted bounds for the specific model you're using.

***

## URL Input & Duration Limits

For endpoints processing content via direct URLs (e.g., X Spaces), specific duration limits apply regardless of file size.

**1. Audio-to-Text** (X/Twitter Spaces)

* Max Duration: 600 minutes
* Note: Processing speeds for X Spaces may vary due to external bandwidth limits.

**2. Video-to-Text** (X, Kick, Twitch)

* Max Duration: 600 minutes

***

## Rate Limit Errors

When you exceed your rate limit, the API returns a `429 Too Many Requests` response.

**How to handle:**

1. **RPM exceeded** — Wait 60 seconds before retrying
2. **RPD exceeded** — Wait until midnight UTC for daily reset
3. **Need higher limits?** — [Upgrade to Premium](https://dryapi.dev/billing) with any payment for 300 RPM and unlimited daily requests
